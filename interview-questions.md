# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is an algorithm that takes a particular input and results an output based on what you instruct the function to return. I would use a function where multiple outputs needed to be returned and don't want to evaluate each one seperately. Functions are reusable so the logic of the function would only needed to be written once and multiple arguments can be passed into the function and returned.    

  Researched answer: "A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output." -MDN



2. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: console.log() will show the value, in your terminal or console, of what you're asking to return. Return does not print out the value but the value is stored in the logic of the function.  

  Researched answer: "So, console.log is a function that logs the arguments you pass to the web console. return is a statement which specifies the value returned from a function." -Reddit



3. In regards to functions, what is the difference between an argument and a parameter?

  Your answer: The argument is what gets passed into the function to be evalauated. The parameter is kind of like the placeholder defined as something that will be coming later.

  Researched answer: 
"- Function parameters are the names listed in the function's definition.
- Function arguments are the real values passed to the function.
- Parameters are initialized to the values of the arguments supplied." -MDN



4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer: A built in method is like a shortcut of code logic programmed into the language by the language creator(s).

  Researched answer: "In JavaScript, built-in functions are the global functions that are called globally, rather than on an object." -Programiz.com



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Proper pair programming consists of one programmer programming on the computer AKA "driving" and the 2nd programmer is "navigating" what the driver should be doing. THe navigator is also responsible for looking out for syntax errors and proper syntax spacing/formatting. The driver will be inputting the code to the text editor and the navigator will be researching topics and informing the driver of what should be coming next.

  Researched answer: "Pair programming is basically a growing software development technique in which two individuals work on the single block of code. The programmers undertake one of two parts — the Driver and the navigator. The driver in the process is responsible for diligently drafting code, while the navigator’s job is to review and concentrates on the plan of action." - Medium
